# AI_Usage-in-Student-Life
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized frequency of AI tool usage (e.g., ChatGPT)
- Analyzed correlations between age, education level, and AI reliance
- Grouped students by AI use cases: academic writing, coding help, research
- Identified top tools and platforms used regularly

Machine Learning Insights
  - KMeans Clustering segmented students into:
  - Light Users
  - Academic-Driven Users
  - Heavy/Daily Users

- Classification Models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree):
  - Predicted likelihood of a student being a frequent AI user
  - Accuracy scores used to evaluate model performance

  Key Takeaways
- Majority of students use AI tools for writing assistance and research
- High adoption among tech-savvy and postgraduate students
- Strong potential for personalized learning tools

  Real-World Applications
- EdTech can improve design of student-centric AI tools  
- Universities can develop better digital literacy programs  
- Policy Makers can guide ethical AI use in learning environments

  Future Work
- Add sentiment analysis on open-ended responses  
- Expand dataset to include students from more institutions  
- Integrate time-based trends for longitudinal analysis
